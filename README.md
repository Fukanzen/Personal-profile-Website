Welcome to my personal profile website! This website is designed to showcase myself, my personality, education background, and my hobbies.
The website is divided into 3 pages, which can be accessed using the navigation bar at the top of the page. The pages include:

  Profile: The landing page, where it gives an introduction of me and what am I currently doing, this page also gives you more information about my personality based on 16 personality test [https://www.16personalities.com]

  Hobbies: This page highlights my activites during free times, and what I'm interested in.
  
  Contact: Here you'll find my contact information, as well as a form that you can use to get in touch with me.

Design:

The website is designed to be chill and based on what my interest. I mainly focused on the dark blue, and used spaced theme images as the background to spice things up. The site isn't made responsive, so it's better to view it on desktop on 100% zoom display.

Thanks for visiting my personal profile website, and I hope you find the information here useful and informative!
